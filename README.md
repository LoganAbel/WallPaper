Adds Wallpapers generated dynamically from shaders

# Running
Run main.py

Changing which shader is selected will close the program, and reopening main.py will run the current shader.

# Adding Shaders
options.txt contains a list of available shaders. add your shader file name on a new line, and add \[your shader name\].glsl into the directory.

Shaders follow the format of shaders on shadertoy, but only iDate, iTime, and iResolution uniforms are currently available
